SUBJECT: Sprint plans

Alec and I have drafted up our plans for the next three sprints.

For our first sprint, we will create technical specifications of the components of the projects by choosing what data structures we want to represent our components with. Then, we will implement the structure of the game board.

Once we have the structure of the game board, we'll be ready to add players and a referee for basic functionality. For our second sprint, we plan to create the player-referee interface and implement basic referee logic. In order to test this, we will create an example player. This could also be the foundation for running our house players.

With players, a referee, and a game board, we'll be able to wire this up for remote players. For our third sprint, we plan to create the communication layer, i.e., the server. The structure for a registration and log-in system will be implemented here.
