## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3


Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

#### Our files in Common/State.java and Common/Board.java are not properly linked to our original files in Common/src/main/java. 

1. rotate the spare tile by some number of degrees

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/alecnorrie-joey/blob/63e3068a931dd22f343fcb15866da99b28b347b3/Maze/Common/src/main/java/State.java#L30-L36

2. shift a row/column and insert the spare tile

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/alecnorrie-joey/blob/63e3068a931dd22f343fcb15866da99b28b347b3/Maze/Common/src/main/java/State.java#L38-L42

   - plus its unit tests

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/alecnorrie-joey/blob/63e3068a931dd22f343fcb15866da99b28b347b3/Maze/Common/src/test/java/TestState.java#L106-L177
   
3. move the avatar of the currently active player to a designated spot

We did not realize this piece of functionality

4. check whether the active player's move has returned its avatar home

We did not realize this piece of functionality

5. kick out the currently active player

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/alecnorrie-joey/blob/63e3068a931dd22f343fcb15866da99b28b347b3/Maze/Common/src/main/java/State.java#L65-L67

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.


If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
