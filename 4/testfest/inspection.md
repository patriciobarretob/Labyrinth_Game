Notes: You seem to already know that some of your names could be better. Address this before next milestone. Or points will be taking off if seen again. Nevertheless you've done a good job with this implementation your public methods are short enough and the flow of data is easy to understand. Work on better naming and writing better purpose statements. 

Note that this grading dosent check if your implementation is correct so check this again.
